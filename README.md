Costco Data Analyst: Los Angeles Locations Ranking

Project Objective: 
    In this project, I am aiming to find a correlation between Yelp rating, number 
    of employees working, and products/quantity available per store. These insights
    help Costco understand how to improve the Costco business model and overall 
    rating. I plan on solving this problem by showcasing the relationships, or lack 
    thereof, between the factors available in the databases. 
    
Job Description: 
    For my project, I chose Costco’s Information Technology Internship, specifically 
    the BI & Analytics – Data Analytics role. Costco Wholesale is a multi-billion 
    dollar global retailer with warehouse club operations. They offer a wide range of
    products and are dedicated to bring members the best possible prices on quality 
    brand-name merchandise. I chose this job because I am currently applying to this 
    position and I would like to provide more value to myself. In the application, 
    the description emphasized performing data analysis, data storytelling, and 
    identifying solutions that support their businesses. It requires 
    the applicant to be enrolled in studying Information Technology at university and 
    prior experience in data visualization. I would typically be “analyzing the 
    selling pattern of certain items” and “creating reports to illustrate the patterns”. 
    Therefore, the problem I plan to solve is the lack of organization with the selling 
    patterns of certain items. I will analyze the patterns of these items and create 
    reports in order to illustrate the patterns. This project helps me improve my 
    data querying skills and finding relationships within the data available.
    
Data: 
    I used data available from Yelp API, Toy Products on Amazon dataset from Kaggle.com, 
    and generatedata.com. The Yelp API was used to extract data relating to the store 
    locations including store official name, rating, address, city, state, zip_code, and
    yelp url. All of this data was stored in one table. The Toy Products on Amazon 
    dataset from Kaggle.com was used in my products table, including product name, price,
    and total quantity on hand. Lastly, the generatedata.com data was used to represent 
    employee data, including first name, last name, age, email, phone number, and salary.
    All of this information was inputed into an employees table.
    
Notebooks: 
    Python Notebook available on posting.
    
Future Improvements: 
    In the future I would change the datasets I used in order to expand the research. I feel
    that I could've found more insightful data if I had found a richer and more dense dataset. 
    In addition to that improvement, I want to use a data visualization tool, such as Tableau, 
    in order to present the data better. This would give me more practice into real-life 
    data analysis findings.
