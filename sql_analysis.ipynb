Each individual is different and has differing needs. Some people value employee interaction/help, some value product selection, and some base the decision entirely upon other's opinions. With this query, I show all possible values to find try and find a correlation with rating from Yelp. I first approached this query by understanding and plotting what columns were most necessary in order to convey the information. I decided to use COUNT() in order to see how many employees work at each store. Next, I used SUM() to add up the total quantity of products that are being held at each location. I used this number rather than counting the number of products because I decided that total quantity would be more beneficial. I then aliased the calculations to improve readability. From there, I looked at the ERD of the database and used multiple JOINs to connect them. The GROUP BY function was lastly used in the CTE to be sure each aggregate function is being properly calculated. I decided to use a Common Table Expression because I find this to be easier to use and read. After the CTE is formatted, I used the AVG() Windows Function to calculate the average total quantity per rating. This will help understand the differences between locations and ratings. Lastly, I ordered the results first by rating and then by total quantity, both of which descending."

I used the aggregate function, COUNT(), to select the number of total products (using product_id) found in each store (using store_id).

I now recommend that Costco uses the Costco Business Center- Gasoline location as a business model to improve the rest. From the query, I can see that the top 3 locations have high ratings as well as high number of products available. I cannot tell, however, that there is a strong correlation between number of products available and rating. The second location 'Costco Gasoline' in Hawthorn has a 4 star rating and provides a larger array of products, far surpassing the average number per 4 star rating. As you can also see, the average number of products per rating is higher for 3 stars than 4 star ratings. Overall, I would recommend to look at other factors from Hawthron and Inglewood that could provide more insight into higher rating."

This would help Costco deduce if they should hire more employees to be of service to customers. This would potentially lead to higher ratings. I chose to use a VIEW because I wanted to easily save the table for other people to easily use. This would be beneficial to analysts because it saves time and prevents unnecessary mistakes. I began the query by mapping out how I was going to recieve the columns, looking at each table present. I used a JOIN function in order to pull the store data as well as `employee_id`. I then used the COUNT() aggregate function in order to calculate the number of employees that work at each location. Lastly, I grouped by `store_id` to be sure there is no repatition.\n",

Lastly, I used the ORDER BY function to make sure the rating is the initial order, then within the rating ordering by the number of employees working. Both rating and number of employees ordered descending."
